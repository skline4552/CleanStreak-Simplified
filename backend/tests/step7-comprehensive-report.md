- **Natural rate limiting**: 5.1 attempts/second (prevents brute force)
- **Memory usage**: Stable, no memory leaks detected

### Validation Performance
- **Input validation**: <1ms average
- **Email validation**: <1ms average
- **Password strength validation**: <1ms average
- **String sanitization**: <1ms average

## Security Enhancements Made

### Issues Identified and Fixed

1. **Email Validation Enhancement**
   - **Issue**: Incomplete domains (e.g., `user@domain`) were being accepted
   - **Fix**: Updated regex to require TLD (e.g., `user@domain.com`)
   - **Impact**: Prevents invalid email addresses from being stored

2. **XSS Prevention Enhancement**
   - **Issue**: `javascript:` schemes were not being properly sanitized
   - **Fix**: Added comprehensive protocol and function blocking
   - **Impact**: Prevents XSS attacks through various injection vectors

3. **Environment Configuration Alignment**
   - **Issue**: Mismatch between password utilities (12) and environment (10) salt rounds
   - **Fix**: Updated environment configuration to use 12 salt rounds
   - **Impact**: Consistent security level across all components

## Configuration Updates

### Environment Files Updated
- **`.env.development`**: Updated `BCRYPT_SALT_ROUNDS=12` for consistency
- **`.env.production`**: Already correctly configured with `BCRYPT_SALT_ROUNDS=12`

### Security Improvements
- Enhanced sanitization in validation utilities
- Improved email validation with TLD requirements
- Consistent bcrypt configuration across all environments

## Next Steps for Authentication System

### Ready for Step 8: JWT Token Management
The password security implementation is now ready for integration with:

1. **JWT Token Generation**: Using secure password hashes for authentication
2. **Authentication Routes**: Registration and login endpoints
3. **User Management**: Secure password storage and validation
4. **Security Middleware**: Rate limiting and validation integration

### Integration Points

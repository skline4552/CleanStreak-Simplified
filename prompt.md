# Cleaning App: New User Flow Redesign

## Overview

Redesign the new user experience to prioritize education and onboarding before presenting any cleaning tasks. New users should understand the app's philosophy, feel confident about what they're committing to, and intentionally build out their home before the task system activates.

## Target Audience

People who:
- Feel overwhelmed by cleaning and don't know where to start
- Are stuck in a cycle of marathon weekend cleaning sessions (or guilt about skipping them)
- Value having a clean home but can't afford or don't want to hire a maid
- Want a sustainable system that makes cleaning feel manageable

## New User Journey

### Phase 1: Landing Page

The landing page is the "sell" - users should fully understand the system and feel motivated to commit before creating an account. Include the following sections:

**The Philosophy**
Introduce the Three Pillars methodology:
- Glass clear (windows, mirrors, glass surfaces)
- Surfaces clear and wiped (countertops, tables, shelves)
- Floor vacuumed/swept

Explain the top-to-bottom approach: each room is cleaned systematically from glass → surfaces → floor before moving to the next room. This ensures every space feels complete and nothing gets missed.

Introduce Keystone Tasks: high-frequency hygiene touchpoints (toilets, sinks, stovetop, shower, microwave) that rotate every 3-5 days because they can't wait for the full room rotation.

**How It Works**
- One task per day, 5-10 minutes or less
- The app handles the "what should I clean?" decision for you
- Tasks rotate intelligently so every area of your home gets attention at the right frequency
- Streak tracking and points keep you motivated
- No more 3-hour weekend cleaning marathons - just consistent, small efforts that add up

**What You'll Need: The Starter Kit**
A comprehensive list of cleaning supplies users should have on hand to complete tasks. This section supports affiliate link monetization. Suggested categories:

- Glass cleaner
- All-purpose surface cleaner
- Bathroom cleaner (or separate toilet/shower cleaners)
- Microfiber cloths
- Vacuum (or broom/dustpan for hard floors)
- Mop or Swiffer-style floor cleaner
- Toilet brush
- Scrub brush or sponges
- Optional: duster/extendable duster for ceiling fans and high surfaces

Frame this as "gather your toolkit" - setting users up for success before they start.

**FAQ Section**

*Who is this app for?*
This app is for people who value a clean home but feel overwhelmed by the prospect of cleaning it. If you've ever put off cleaning because it feels like a huge time commitment, or found yourself trapped in a cycle of weekend cleaning marathons followed by weeks of guilt, this system is designed for you. It breaks the work into small daily tasks so cleaning becomes a habit, not an event.

*How long does each task take?*
Most daily tasks take 5-10 minutes. The goal is to make cleaning so quick and easy that you actually do it consistently.

*What if I miss a day?*
Life happens. The app won't punish you - it will simply pick up where you left off. Your streak may reset, but your home won't fall apart from one missed task. The system is designed to be forgiving while still encouraging consistency.

*Can I skip or swap a task?*
Yes. If today's task doesn't work for you (maybe guests are using the bathroom you're supposed to clean, or you're out of glass cleaner), you can skip it and move on. The task will cycle back around eventually.

*How does the task rotation work?*
The app works through your home room by room, completing each of the three pillars (glass, surfaces, floor) before moving to the next room. In between, it inserts Keystone Tasks - the high-touch hygiene areas like toilets and sinks that need attention more frequently.

*What supplies do I need?*
See our Starter Kit section above. You likely already have most of what you need - the basics are glass cleaner, surface cleaner, bathroom cleaner, microfiber cloths, and a vacuum or broom.

*How often will each room be cleaned?*
It depends on how many rooms you have, but the system ensures every room cycles through all three pillars regularly. Keystone Tasks (toilets, sinks, stovetop, shower, microwave) rotate every 3-5 days so they're touched at least monthly, often more.

**Call to Action**
Clear button/prompt to create an account and start building their home.

### Phase 2: Account Creation & Onboarding

After creating an account, users are guided through building out their home. No tasks are presented until this phase is complete.

**Room Setup Flow**
- User adds rooms one at a time
- For each room, they specify the room type (living room, bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, office, etc.)
- For each room, they answer: "Does this room have mirrors or windows?" (determines whether Glass pillar is included)
- User can add custom room names if needed
- No pre-built templates or minimum room requirements - users intentionally decide what to include

**Keystone Task Configuration**
Based on the rooms they've added, the app identifies which Keystone Tasks apply:
- Bathrooms → toilet(s), sink(s), shower/tub
- Kitchen → sink, stovetop, microwave

The user should see/confirm which Keystone Tasks will be part of their rotation.

**Setup Complete Milestone**
When the user indicates they're done adding rooms, present a satisfying "setup complete" moment:
- Summary of their home (X rooms, Y Keystone Tasks)
- Confirmation that their personalized task rotation has been generated
- Clear transition into "Your first task is ready" or similar

---

### Phase 3: Active Use

Only after completing onboarding does the user see their dashboard with:
- Today's task
- Streak counter
- Points/progress indicators
- Option for Power Clean (30-minute task for bonus points) if feeling motivated

---

## Key Principles

1. **Education before action**: Users understand the system fully before committing
2. **Intentional setup**: No shortcuts or templates - users think through their home
3. **Clear milestone**: Satisfying transition from setup to active use
4. **Accessible tone**: Speak to overwhelmed people with empathy, not judgment
5. **Value proposition upfront**: Landing page should make users think "this is exactly what I need"

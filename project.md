# CleanStreak User Authentication System - Project Specification

## Project Overview

### Transition Goals
Transform CleanStreak_Simplified from its current session-only JavaScript memory system to a full user authentication system that enables persistent data storage and cross-session continuity while preserving the application's core strength: extreme simplicity and zero-friction daily habit formation.

### Success Criteria
- Users can create accounts and maintain cleaning streaks across browser sessions
- Anonymous usage remains available for new users to experience the app immediately
- Application maintains sub-second load times and single-click task completion
- Zero disruption to existing core user flow: see task → complete → get dopamine hit
- Seamless transition from anonymous to authenticated usage

## Current State Analysis

### Existing JavaScript-Based Memory System
**Current Architecture:**
- Single HTML file (272 lines) with embedded CSS and JavaScript
- Session-only state management using two variables: `currentStreak` and `lastCompletedDate`
- 50 pre-defined cleaning tasks with date-based rotation algorithm
- No external dependencies, frameworks, or build processes
- Mobile-responsive design with satisfying completion animations

**Current Data Flow:**
1. Page loads → variables initialize with defaults (streak: 0, lastCompleted: null)
2. User sees today's task and current session streak
3. User completes task → state updates in memory → UI refreshes
4. Page refresh/navigation → all data lost

**Core Strengths to Preserve:**
- Instant accessibility (no login required to start)
- Zero setup friction
- Single-file architecture simplicity
- Fast, responsive user interface
- Focus on daily habit formation over complex features

## Target Architecture

### Hybrid Authentication Model
**Design Philosophy:** Progressive enhancement from anonymous to authenticated usage

**User Journey Paths:**
1. **Anonymous Users** (Default Experience)
   - Immediate access to full functionality
   - Session-only streak tracking (current behavior)
   - Gentle prompts to create account after engagement patterns indicate value

2. **Authenticated Users** (Enhanced Experience)
   - Persistent streak tracking across sessions and devices
   - Historical data preservation
   - Seamless login/logout without losing current session

3. **Transition Flow** (Anonymous → Authenticated)
   - Preserve current session data when user creates account
   - No data loss during account creation process
   - Transparent migration of streak and completion data

### Technical Architecture Overview

**Frontend Components:**
- Enhanced single HTML file with authentication UI components
- Progressive disclosure: authentication options hidden until needed
- Maintained zero-framework, vanilla JavaScript approach

**Backend Infrastructure:**
- Lightweight authentication service (Node.js/Express or similar)
- Session management with secure cookies
- RESTful API endpoints for user data operations
- Database for user accounts and persistent streak data

**Data Synchronization:**
- Bi-directional sync between local state and server
- Offline-first approach with sync on reconnection
- Conflict resolution for edge cases

## Technical Requirements

### Backend Infrastructure

**Authentication Service Requirements:**
- User registration with email/username and password
- Secure password hashing (bcrypt with salt rounds ≥10)
- JWT-based session management with HTTP-only secure cookies
- Password reset functionality via email
- Account deletion and data export capabilities

**Database Design:**
```
Users Table:
- user_id (primary key, UUID)
- username (unique, 3-50 characters)
- email (unique, validated format)
- password_hash (bcrypt)
- created_at (timestamp)
- last_login (timestamp)
- account_status (active/suspended/deleted)

User_Streaks Table:
- user_id (foreign key)
- current_streak (integer)
- last_completed_date (date)
- total_completions (integer)
- longest_streak (integer)
- created_at (timestamp)
- updated_at (timestamp)

Completion_History Table:
- user_id (foreign key)
- completion_date (date)

**Migration Logic:**
```javascript
// Pseudocode for anonymous-to-authenticated transition
function migrateSessionToAccount(sessionData, userAccount) {
    if (sessionData.currentStreak > userAccount.currentStreak) {
        // Preserve higher session streak if legitimate
        return syncSessionDataToServer(sessionData);
    }
    return mergeBestOfBothSources(sessionData, userAccount);
}
```

### Phase 4: Enhancement & Polish (Week 4-5)

## User Experience Design

### Authentication Flow Design
**Design Principles:**
- Never interrupt the core task completion flow
- Authentication options appear progressively based on user engagement
- Clear value proposition for creating an account
- Instant access without account creation

**Optimal Timing for Authentication Prompts:**
1. After user completes 3+ tasks (demonstrates engagement)
2. When user returns after 24+ hours (shows habit formation)
3. When user reaches 7-day streak (milestone achievement)
4. Never during task completion flow (preserve focus)

### Interface Integration
**Header Addition:**
```html
<!-- Minimal header addition -->
<div class="user-header">
    <div class="user-status" id="userStatus">
        <!-- Anonymous: "Guest Mode" -->
        <!-- Authenticated: "Welcome back, [name]" -->
    </div>
    <div class="user-actions" id="userActions">
        <!-- Anonymous: "Save Progress" button -->
        <!-- Authenticated: User menu -->
    </div>
</div>
```

**Modal Design:**
- Overlay authentication forms to avoid navigation disruption
- Single-step registration process (username, email, password)
- Clear benefits messaging: "Save your streak across devices"
- Social proof: "Join [number] users building cleaning habits"

### Progressive Enhancement Strategy
**Anonymous User Experience (Preserved):**
- Immediate access to full app functionality
- Session-based streak tracking
- Complete feature parity with current implementation
- Subtle "Save your progress" hints after engagement

**Account Creation Value Proposition:**
- "Never lose your streak again"
- "Access your progress from any device"
- "Join the community of consistent cleaners"
- "Track your long-term improvement"

**Authenticated User Experience (Enhanced):**
- Persistent streak across sessions
- Historical completion data
- Achievement milestones and celebrations
- Gentle community features (anonymous aggregate stats)

## Data Migration

### Anonymous-to-Authenticated Transition
**Session Preservation Strategy:**
```javascript
// Capture current session state
const sessionSnapshot = {
    currentStreak: getCurrentStreak(),
    lastCompletedDate: getLastCompletedDate(),
    todayCompleted: isTodayCompleted(),
    sessionStartDate: getSessionStartDate()
};

// During account creation, merge with user account
function createAccountWithSessionData(userCredentials, sessionData) {
    return api.register({
        ...userCredentials,
        initialStreak: sessionData.currentStreak,
        lastCompleted: sessionData.lastCompletedDate,
        preserveSession: true
    });
}
```

**Data Validation Rules:**
1. Session streaks only count if consistent with date logic
2. Maximum session streak transfer: 30 days (prevents manipulation)
3. Server data takes precedence for historical records
4. Current day completion status determined by most recent action

### Backward Compatibility
**Anonymous Usage Support:**
- Full functionality available without account creation
- No degraded experience for non-authenticated users
- Clear opt-in approach to account creation
- Ability to return to anonymous mode (logout with session reset)
